GUI Features
============

Useful hotkeys
--------------
- \* makes the full cell hierarchy visible. Otherwise only cell frames may be
  visible. Also accessible from "Display -> Full hierarchy" in the top menu.
- F2 centers the view on the top cell.
- Shift+F2 centers the view on the selected cell.

Placing Elements
----------------

KQC ``Elements`` are implemented as KLayout PCells. There are two ways to insert ``Elements`` into the layout:

#. dragging from **Libraries** toolbox

#. using "instance" tool from the toolbar

Either of these makes KLayout ask for a corresponding **PCell** instance from the **Library**.
If the corresponding **PCell instance** does not yet exist, corresponding code from the KQC library is evoked.

Here is an animation demonstrating dragging from the **Libraries** toolbox

Modifying Element parameters
----------------------------

If an ``Element`` is in the layout, one can change its **parameters** by double clicking the ``Element`` which should make
**Object properties** window appear. In the window there is a **PCell parameters** tab. Changes in the parameters
take effect when one clicks **Ok** or **Apply**.
At this event, corresponding **PCell** instance is created or reused from the **Library**.

Due to the non-intuitive way KLayout is implemented there are a few common mistakes which prevent one from getting
**Object properties** window when double clicking the element.

* One is clicking on a ``Box`` instead of a ``PCell instance``. Some PCells have boxes around them and selecting a box has a higher importance than selecting an instance. One can see which is selected from the bottom edge of the screen. One can disable selecting boxes from "Edit -> Select" dropdown menu.
* The ``Element`` is no longer a PCell. If the PCell has been "turned static" it is no longer generated by code and parameters cannot be changed.
* The ``Element`` is inside another PCell. One can only change parameters of the top level Element. If one desires to change parameters of the sub-elements, the top level element should be turned static before.

Modifying waveguides
--------------------

Some PCell parameters are geometric objects. For example, ``Coplanar Waveguide`` has a "guide path" parameter. In the
cell view window it is displayed as a black `Path` object. The geometric parameters can be changed using `Partial` tool
in the toolbar.

* Double clicking a path creates additional nodes.
* Dragging edges shifts the edge and adds orthogonal segments to keep the path connected.
* Dragging nodes shifts the nodes.

PCell shape is updated after each change in the parameters.
