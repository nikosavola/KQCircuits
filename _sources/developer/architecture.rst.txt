Architecture
------------

This section explains some things about the KQCircuits code architecture.

Elements
^^^^^^^^

Every KQCircuits object that can be placed in a KLayout layout is derived from
``Element``. There exist also more specific base classes such as ``Chip``,
or ``TestStructure``, which inherit from ``Element``. Elements in KQCircuits
are PCells (see `KLayout documentation <https://www.klayout
.de/doc-qt5/about/about_pcells.html>`__ for more information on PCells), or
more specifically, they inherit from `PCellDeclarationHelper <https://www
.klayout.de/doc-qt4/code/class_PCellDeclarationHelper.html>`__. Due to how
KLayout handles PCells, the elements (i.e. classes inheriting from Element) in
KQCircuits should not be treated as normal Python classes. The following
things should be taken into account when writing new elements:

#.  PCells in Python code have corresponding objects living in the C++-side of
    KLayout. This means that you should not instantiate any elements like a
    normal class, but instead use the ``add_element`` or ``create`` method of the
    element, which are wrappers for KLayout's ``layout.create_cell``.  These
    wrappers are used to validate the parameters using the ``Validator`` in
    ``parameter_helper.py``. The C++-object is created properly only if you use
    these wrappers (or if a new PCell is added to a layout in KLayout GUI).

#.  In code ``add_element`` is the preferred method of adding a new (sub)cell. The
    ``create`` method is a ``@classmethod`` that is useful when adding a top
    level PCell or when not calling from another PCell.

#.  When a new PCell instance is created, or when the parameters are changed in
    KLayout GUI, the ``produce_impl`` method of the PCell is called. This
    method is where you "build" the PCell. When ``produce_impl`` is called, the
    instance variables of the PCell are set to new values based on the given
    parameters. The PCell instance is then created or updated based on these
    new parameter values.

#.  The PCell parameters for KQCircuits elements are plain class attributes
    defined with the help of ``Param`` descriptor class. These can be used like
    normal instance variables.
    The values of these parameters can be set from the KLayout GUI, or in the
    ``create`` or ``add_element`` methods in code.  The parameters of a class
    are automatically merged with its parent's parameters (see ``element.py``),
    so an instance will contain the parameters of all its ancestors in the
    inheritance hierarchy.

#.  The ``add_parameters_from`` decorator function adds some other class'
    parameters to the decorated class. They are like normal parameters to all
    intents and purposes and can be overridden by the class parameters. Note
    that these parameters will be inherited by descendants of the decorated
    class.

Libraries
^^^^^^^^^

The PCells in KQCircuits are divided into libraries such as ``elements``,
``chips`` and ``test_structures``. Each library contains a base class for all
other classes in the library, for example all classes in ``chips`` library
inherit from ``Chip``. The base class contains ``LIBRARY_NAME`` and
``LIBRARY_DESCRIPTION``, so that these are available for all elements.

The elements in these libraries are automatically discovered and registered to
KLayout by ``library_helper.py``. It finds all classes in KQCircuits
directory which inherit from ``PCellDeclarationHelper``, and uses their
``LIBRARY_NAME`` attribute to register them to the correct library. Note
that this requires all element classes to follow PascalCase naming
convention, as required by PEP-8.

pya resolver
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Any KLayout functions/classes/etc. should be imported using ``pya_resolver``
(see ``pya_resolver.py``). For example, you should write
``from kqcircuits.pya_resolver import pya``, and **not** ``import pya`` or
``import klayout.db``. This ensures that KQCircuits works both with KLayout
GUI and the standalone module.
